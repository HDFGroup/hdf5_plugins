Installation
===========================================================================
The customary location for the plugins is under the hdf5 libraries location.
   The plugins depend on the environment variable, HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH, and can
   be installed into any location.
On linux, the installer should be executed in the location to install the
   plugin. The plugins will install into the location:
            <current dir>/HDF_Group/HDF5/1.10/lib/plugin
On Windows, the installer will default to the same location as the hdf5 installer:
   C:/Program Files/HDF_Group/HDF5/1.10 and into the /lib/plugin dir.
1. Execute @H5ZSTD_PACKAGE_NAME@-@H5ZSTD_PACKAGE_VERSION@-@BINARY_SYSTEM_NAME@.@BINARY_INSTALL_ENDING@
2. Follow prompts
===========================================================================

After Installation, Test using CMake
===========================================================================
The HDF5 Plugins examples expect a HDF5 library built with CMake, but can be
    used with an autotools built binary. Normally the plugins are installed
    with the HDF5 library.

Copy the following dir and file from the share dir in the H5PL INSTALL location
   to your working dir:
       HDFPLExamples
       H5PL_Examples.cmake

Execute the ctest script:
  ctest -S H5PL_Examples.cmake,HDF5INSTALLDIR=<hdf5 root location> -C Release -VV -O test.log
    where <hdf5 root location> has the following dirs;
    on windows:
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------lib
         ------cmake
    on linux:
         ------bin
         ------include
         ------lib
         ------share
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not use the ctest script, you must supply the following environment
    variables:
        HDF5_ROOT
        HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    and make and cd into a build folder:
    and execute:
        cmake -C ../HDFPLExamples/config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake \
            -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -G "Unix Makefiles" \
            ../HDFPLExamples
    and execute:
         cmake --build . --config Release
    and execute:
         ctest . -C Release

===========================================================================

After Installation, Test using h5cc on linux
===========================================================================
The compression library assumes that HDF5 is installed to the directory
pointed to by the environment variable HDF5_HOME, e.g. HDF5_HOME=/usr/local/hdf5.

It can be installed in user space or admin space, as long as this variable is
defined properly.

The installed version of HDF5 must have been built with ‐‐enable‐static=no in
order to force the hdf5 tools to use dynamic linking, which is required by the plugin.

By default, HDF5 looks for plugins to be installed in $HDF5_HOME/lib/plugin.
Be sure to copy the shared plugins libraries (*.so files) from this install
to the $HDF5_HOME/lib/plugin folder.

Copy the following dir from the share dir in the H5PL INSTALL location
   to your working dir:
       HDFPLExamples

Change your working dir to the HDFPLExamples/example/test folder.

Execute the test.sh script.
