/**
* VariableFilter
*
* Abstract superclass to all filter classes. This defines the interface for filterNcFile() to use.
* When a VariableFilter is instantiated, it is not fully initialized: It still lacks information about the data to process. This is due to the fact, that filterNcFile() needs to accept a single filter but has to apply it to different variables. So, the variable information has to be supplied via vf_setVarProperties() prior to calling vf_process().
*
* Polymorphism is coded by hand, i. e. overriding subclass functions are explicitely called by the generic one. So before a subclass becomes functional, the corresponding calls have to be added to variable-filter.c.
*
* All subclasses must implement:
* xxx_varPropertiesSet(SubClass* me)    //Called at the end of vf_setVarProperties() to inform the subclass.
* xxx_process(SubClass* me, const void* inputBuffer, void* outputBuffer)
* xxx_destroy(SubClass* me)    //The polymorphic destructor part.
