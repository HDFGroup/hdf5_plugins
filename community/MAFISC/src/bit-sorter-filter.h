/**
* BitSorterFilter
*
* This filter sorts the bits by their position in the values into the record, i. e. all sign bits form a single consecutive block that is zero iff no negative values are present in the data. Since there are frequently bits that are always set in a value or not set, this leads to large uniform block that can be compressed well, at the expense of making other parts look quite random.
