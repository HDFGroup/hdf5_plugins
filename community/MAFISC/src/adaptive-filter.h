/**
* AdaptiveFilter
*
* A filter that uses the last values seen in each direction (only backwards, not forward) to make a prediction for the next value. The value stored in the output buffer is the input value minus the prediction. There are several methods implemented to adapt the predictions to the data, the method to use is chosen by some constants in adaptive-filter.c.
