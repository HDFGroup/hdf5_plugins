The HDF Group Registered Third-Party Filters (Compression) webpage:
        https://support.hdfgroup.org/services/contributions.html

This is a list of filters included into the Compression Plugin Library
    and some parameter settings pulled from the corresponding filter
    compression reference  sites.


BZIP2 Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 307

Filter Description:
    bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data
    compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to
    15% of the best available techniques (the PPM family of
    statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast
    at compression and six times faster at decompression.

JPEG Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32019

Filter Description:
    This is a lossy compression filter.
    It provides a user-specified "quality factor" to control the
    trade-off of size versus accuracy.

Author

--------------------------------------------
Requirements
    libjpeg This library is available as a package for most Linux
    distributions, and source code is available from https://www.ijg.org/.
--------------------------------------------
Restrictions
    Only 8-bit unsigned data arrays are supported.
    Arrays must be either:
        2-D monochromatic [NumColumns, NumRows]
        3-D RGB [3, NumColumns, NumRows]
    Chunking must be set to the size of one entire image so the filter
    is called once for each image.


Using the JPEG filter in your application
    HDF5 only supports compression for "chunked" datasets;
    this just means that you need to call H5Pset_chunk to specify a chunk size.
    The chunking must be set to the size of a single image for the
    JPEG filter to work properly.

    When calling H5Pset_filter for compression it must be called with
    cd_nelmts=4 and cd_values as follows:

        cd_values[0] = quality factor (1-100)
        cd_values[1] = numColumns
        cd_values[2] = numRows
        cd_values[3] = 0=Mono, 1=RGB

Common h5repack parameter: UD=32019,0,4,q,c,r,t

LZF Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32000

Filter Description:
    The LZF filter is an alternative DEFLATE-style compressor for
    HDF5 datasets, using the free LZF library by Marc Alexander Lehmann.
    Its main benefit over the built-in HDF5 DEFLATE filter is speed;
    in memory-to-memory operation as part of the filter pipeline, it
    typically compresses 3x-5x faster than DEFLATE, and decompresses
    2x faster, while maintaining 50% to 90% of the DEFLATE compression
    ratio. LZF can be used to compress any data type, and requires no
    compile-time or run-time configuration. The filter is written in C
    and can be included directly in C or C++ applications; it has no
    external dependencies. The license is 3-clause BSD (virtually
    unrestricted, including commercial applications).

    More information, downloads, and benchmarks, are available at:
    http://h5py.org/lzf/.

Additional Information:
    The LZF filter was developed as part of the h5py project, which implements a general-purpose interface to HDF5 from Python.

BLOSC Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32001

Filter Description:
    Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data.
    It has been designed to compress data very fast, at the expense
    of achieving lesser compression ratios than, say, zlib+shuffle.
    It is mainly meant to not introduce a significant delay when
    dealing with data that is stored in high-performance I/O systems
    (like large RAID cabinets, or even the OS filesystem memory cache).

    It uses advanced cache-efficient techniques to reduce activity on
    the memory bus as much as possible. It also leverages SIMD (SSE2)
    and multi-threading capabilities present in nowadays multi-core
    processors so as to accelerate the compression/decompression
    process to a maximum.

MAFISC Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32002

Filter Description:
    This compressing filter exploits the multidimensionality and
    smoothness characterizing many scientific data sets. It adaptively
    applies some filters to preprocess the data and uses lzma as the
    actual compression step. It significantly outperforms pure lzma
    compression on most datasets.

    The software is currently under a rather unrestrictive two clause BSD style license.

LZ4 Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32004

Filter Description:
    LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing
    compression speed at 300 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores
    CPU. It also features an extremely fast decoder, with speeds up
    and beyond 1GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits
    on multi-core systems. For a format description of the LZ4
    compression filter in HDF5, see HDF5_LZ4.pdf.

ZFP Filter
=================================
Filter Id: 32013

Filter Description:
    zfp is a BSD licensed open source C++ library for compressed
    floating-point arrays that support very high throughput read
    and write random access. zfp was designed to achieve high
    compression ratios and therefore uses lossy but optionally
    error-bounded compression. Although bit-for-bit lossless
    compression is not always possible, zfp is usually accurate
    to within machine epsilon in near-lossless mode, and is often
    orders of magnitude more accurate and faster than other lossy
    compressors.

    This plugin supports all 4 modes of the ZFP compression library,
    rate, accuracy, precision and expert. It supports 1, 2 and 3
    dimensional datasets of single and double precision integer and
    floating point data. It can be applied to HDF5 datasets of more
    than 3 dimensions as long as no more than 3 dimensions of the
    chunking are of size greater than 1.

Zstandard Filter
=================================
Filter ID: 32015

Filter Description:
  zstd, short for Zstandard, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting
  real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios.
  The zstd compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression
  functions.

Link to the compression library:
    https://github.com/facebook/zstd

--------------------------------------------
Compression Library Included: zstd version 1.5.2

Plugin cd_value option
--------------------------------------------
This has 1 optional value;
    compression level: default, 3
  The library supports regular compression levels from 1 up to ZSTD_maxCLevel(),
  which is currently 22. Levels >= 20, labeled `--ultra`, should be used with
  caution, as they require more memory. The library also offers negative
  compression levels, which extend the range of speed vs. ratio preferences.
  The lower the level, the faster the speed (at the cost of compression).

Default h5repack parameter: UD=32015,0,0
